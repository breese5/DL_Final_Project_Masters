course_overview,"The summer of 2024 dealt Augusta National one of its biggest challenges ever in the form of Hurricane Helene, which devastated large parts of the interior south. According to the National Hurricane Center, Helene wiped out almost 400 homes and dealt significant damage to more than 6,000 more. Augusta National was not spared, either, losing an unknown but reportedly significant amount of trees. Pros who have visited the course in the lead-up to the 2025 Masters have remarked on a slightly roomier feel in some places. After a March scouting trip, Rory McIlroy mentioned that four of Augusta National's greens have been resurfaced ahead of this year's tournament. One of them, the 16th, was described by 2018 Masters champion Patrick Reed as ""completely destroyed"" by felled trees and flooding after Helene, but it has been rebuilt exactly as it was before. Tees and green surrounds: 5/16""
Fairways: 3/8""
Second cut: 1 3/8""
Collars: 1/4""
Greens: 1/8"". Par 72, 7,520 yards"
hole1,"No gentle handshake here. The opening hole at Augusta National is historically the sixth-toughest on the course, with an all-time scoring average of a quarter-shot over par. Players hit into an upslope, which tempers any chance of significant rollout, and the opposite positioning of the hole's two bunkers - fairway bunker on the right, greenside bunker on the left - make it something of a ""switchback"" hole, immediately testing a player's comfort with working the ball both ways. Like many greens on the course, the putting surface sheds marginal shots down into chipping areas and features distinct sections. It took Ernie Els seven putts - six of them within three feet - to hole out here in the first round of the 2016 Masters."
hole2,"This downhill, sweeping dogleg-left offers a great chance for a birdie or eagle if players can skirt both the lone fairway bunker to the right and the forested ravine to the left. Two greenside bunkers pinch the opening of the angled, T-shaped green, which falls from short-left down to the back-right corner, where the traditional Sunday hole location sits. The tilt of the putting surface is such that well-calibrated approaches can drift down from the front corner of the green on a 30-yard journey toward the cup. In 2012, Louis Oosthuizen pulled this shot off to perfection, making a 2 en route to his runner-up finish to Bubba Watson in the year's memorable playoff."
hole3,"Although recent increases in driving distance have prompted changes to several holes at Augusta National and other great championship golf courses, there is a case to be made that this hole has become more intriguing as a result. Players can lay back next to a nest of four fairway bunkers and leave a full wedge, or they can elect to drive the ball close to the small, right-to-left-tilting green, but at the risk of leaving themselves an extremely delicate uphill pitch if they stray left. When the cup is located on the green's shallow front-left lobe, it is not uncommon to see players miss the green from as close as 30 yards. What the hole lacks in length, it makes up in guile and demands on every player's powers of precision."
hole4,"The longest par 3 on the golf course plays downhill to an L-shaped green with two large bunkers lapping at its edges. When the hole is cut close over the right-front bunker, it can seem impossible to access, but a backstop exists that can gather the ball close if a player judges everything correctly. Phil Mickelson's bid to win the 2012 Masters ended here when he made a triple-bogey 6."
hole5,"Bobby Jones and Alister MacKenzie were both inspired by the Old Course at St. Andrews when they set out to create Augusta National. This hole's green complex invokes the famous Road Hole, the legendary 17th hole of the ancient links. It is long and difficult like its inspiration, with a green that is very difficult to hold because of a massive false front that rejects anything but a soaring approach. Merely having a chance to attack this green is far from certain, as two yawning fairway bunkers squeeze the fairway on the left off the tee."
hole6,"Multifaceted greens are a major theme at Augusta National, and this downhill par 3's putting surface is eclectic, and can make the hole play dramatically different one day to the next. When the hole is located on the small back-left tier, it can seem like one must hit a mid-iron onto a car hood. When it is located in the lower-left portion of the green, holes-in-one are not out of the question, like the one Corey Conners made in the final round of the 2021 Masters."
hole7,"In the several rounds of changes Augusta National has seen this century, few have been as significant as the lengthening of this hole by nearly 100 yards, turning it from a wood and a wedge to a drive (down a straight, narrow corridor) and a middle-iron uphill to a green surrounded by bunkers. In spite of its length, it can still provide thrills when players can use the pitch of the green to work the ball backwards toward a cup cut in a low area."
hole8,"Augusta National's par 5s separate the best drivers of the golf ball by rewarding great tee shots significantly more than mediocre ones. That is especially true here; avoiding the fairway bunker off the tee sets up a slinging right-to-left fairway wood up the hill to this unique green couched by mounds. The preferred side to miss changes with the pin position each day, underscoring the importance of course knowledge and experience."
hole9,"Length off the tee is a big factor here due to the angle of this hole's famous stair-stepped green. Every year, it forces some players to have to putt with their backs to the cup when they are out of position. The farther - and farther right - a player can position a drive down this fairway, the less impetuous the bunkers that hug the left side of the putting surface become."
hole10,"Players will need to calibrate both how far they plan to fly their tee shots and how much they will turn them from right to left here. Not enough sweep and they can lose out on as much as 50 or 60 yards of extra roll down the hill. The course's most expressively shaped bunker - which fronted the green in the early days - serves as a foreground to the approach to a severely tilted green from back-right to front left. The hardest hole over the course of Masters history, this is part of the reason for the famous adage about the tournament not truly beginning until the second nine on Sunday."
hole11,"After a tee shot that must hug the right treeline for the best angle, players head into championship golf's grandest living room: Amen Corner. The green tilts toward the pond, but the two mounds that front the putting surface can be used by a clever and steel-nerved player to propel a long approach close to the day's hole location. In 2022, the Masters tees were moved 15 yards back and to the left, straightening the hole slightly. Some right-side trees were removed, rewarding a more aggressive tee shot with a better look at the green."
hole12,"What more can be said about this hole that photos don't already communicate? What a contrast players face between the stadium-like atmosphere of the tee box and the quiet remove of the green complex tucked between Rae's Creek, three bunkers and the forested edge of the property! What perplexing swirling winds await them! What momentum-building birdies and round-killing double-bogeys await! What a special place in the game."
hole13,"A testament to the advantages of using the natural contours of the land to fashion interesting golf, Alister MacKenzie did little to manipulate this hole, which has become known as one of the best three-shotters in the world. The tilt of the fairway makes the long approach over a tributary of Rae's Creek exciting due to the unavoidable hanging lies players will face. The two-level green reveals a diverse set of pin positions, all of which require players to approach it in subtly different ways. In 2023, a new back tee was built to add as much as 35 yards to this iconic hole. In order to add it, the club had to purchase several acres from neighboring Augusta Country Club in order to accommodate the change, prompting ACC to shift its 9th hole to the left."
hole14,"Augusta National's only bunkerless hole is a strong argument for why bunkers can be overrated and overused on many courses. Contour, like that found on and around this heaving green, provides plenty of challenge and day-to-day variety. The typical Sunday back-center hole location provides ample opportunity for hole-outs, while a middle-left pin needs to be approached very cautiously."
hole15,"The last of Augusta National's superlative par fives plays over a rise and down to one of the more intimidating greens in golf. The shallow putting surface shrugs balls off the front into a pond just as easily as the back can springboard approaches toward and even into the pond that fronts the 16th tee. Players who lay up are faced with one of the toughest wedge shots in the game, off a downslope to the crowned putting surface. That is what makes approaches like Jack Nicklaus' 4-iron in 1986 and Sergio Garcia's 8-iron in 2017 so heroic. Each led to eagles that propelled their authors to victory."
hole16,"Once again, the large and sweeping contours of Augusta National's greens make this hole play drastically differently one day to the next. When the cup is cut on the elevated right half of the green, birdies can be scarce. But come Sunday, when the pin position sits on the lower left-hand portion of the green, holes-in-one are not uncommon, despite the cup's proximity to the water. It is a versatile, exciting hole that always plays a starring role in the late drama of any tense edition of the Masters."
hole17,"Although the famed Eisenhower Tree has been gone for nine years, this hole still perplexes players every year. The contours of the green come courtesy of Perry Maxwell, who updated it from MacKenzie's original design in 1937. Those ""Maxwell rolls"" make approaches from even the ideal position off the tee tricky. Many golfers have had the green jacket slip through their fingers here."
hole18,"It is far from the flashiest hole at Augusta National, but it is a sturdy, solid test worthy of the dozens of major championships that have been settled on its two-level putting surface. First things first, though: the drive must get through the chute of trees at the bottom of the hill and come to rest short of the two fairway bunkers. As is the case throughout the course, the traditional Sunday pin position sits in a low area over the front greenside bunker, ripe for a heroic approach that either takes dead aim or uses the sideboard and backboard slopes to feed a ball close."
preview_1,"AUGUSTA, Ga. -- Fifteen-time major championTiger Woodswon't tee it up in the 89th Masters because he's recovering from a ruptured left Achilles tendon, but there are still plenty of storylines as the world's best golfers descend on Augusta National Golf Club this week. World No. 1Scottie Schefflerwill try to joinJack Nicklaus(1963, 1965 and 1966) as the only golfers to win three green jackets in a four-year span. He can become only the fourth player in Masters history to win in back-to-back years; Nicklaus,Nick Faldo(1989-90) and Woods (2001-02) were the others. World No. 2Rory McIlroymight have better form than Scheffler heading into the first major championship of the season. McIlroy will attempt to become only the sixth golfer in the Masters era to complete the career Grand Slam by capturing a green jacket. It will be McIlroy's 11th attempt, and he'll try to end a major championship drought of more than 10 years. Those aren't the only intriguing storylines in what promises to be a drama-filled week at Augusta National. For the first time in eight months, the best golfers from the PGA Tour and LIV Golf League will be competing in the same field.

preview_2,"Ninety-five players, followingVijay Singh‚Äôs Monday withdrawal, will tee it up in this week‚Äôs Masters Tournament at Augusta National, including world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler, who has won two of the past three editions of the year‚Äôs first major. Despite missing some time with a hand injury earlier this year, Scheffler still has not finished outside the top 25 this year. And while he hasn‚Äôt won since the Hero World Challenge last December, there‚Äôs no reason that Scheffler shouldn‚Äôt be the favorite to win a third green jacket. Augusta National looks a little different this year, mainly because of the many trees that were lost during Hurricane Helene. There are also four new greens, according to Rory McIlroy (Nos. 1, 8, 15 and 16). But it‚Äôs still the same second-shot golf course that will favor elite approach play, crafty scramblers and strong putters, especially those who lag it well. With Scheffler coming off a strong putting performance in Houston, that bodes even better for him. Starting with Scheffler, here‚Äôs how I‚Äôd ranked the entire field: 1. Scottie Scheffler:Hasn‚Äôt gotten in the winner‚Äôs circle recently, but coming off a T-2 in Houston shows the two-time green jacket winner is primed to add to his dazzling record here. He‚Äôs still top-10 in the major ball-striking stats and enters this week ranked in the top 50 in strokes gained putting after a turnaround week on the greens at Memorial Park. 2. Collin Morikawa:Coming off his best Masters finish, a T-3, his third straight top-10 here. He‚Äôs also the PGA Tour‚Äôs leader in strokes gained approach and proximity, and is the hottest player according to Data Golf. A win Sunday would put him just a U.S. Open away from the career grand slam. 3. Justin Thomas:The model ranked Thomas first among PGA Tour players, as he‚Äôs top 10 in strokes gained approach and top 40 in strokes gained putting. Plus, he‚Äôs got three top-10s in his last four starts, so you can ignore those two straight missed cuts at Augusta that came when he was slumping. 4. Rory McIlroy:Enters this week with questions to answer about a right-elbow injury that he casually mentioned in Houston. But if he‚Äôs healthy, he‚Äôs got as good a chance as he‚Äôs had in a while. He‚Äôs won three of his last seven worldwide events and is nearly top 10 in strokes gained putting, but he‚Äôs not hit it particularly close this season (No. 87 in proximity). 5. Jon Rahm:Sunday‚Äôs T-9 at LIV Miami was hisworstfinish of the season. He‚Äôs third on that tour in greens hit, and he‚Äôs got a win and two other top-7s in his last five Masters starts. 6. Shane Lowry:His run of four straight top-20s includes three finishes of T-11 or better. And though he was T-43 last year at Augusta, he was T-3 two years prior as part of a run of four straight top-25s. He‚Äôs sixth in both proximity and strokes gained approach and nearly top 10 in lag putting. He‚Äôs the best outside of the no-brainer picks. 7. Russell Henley:Uncharacteristically average off the tee (barely inside the top 100), but top 25 in the other three major strokes-gained categories. And he‚Äôs got a win and two other top-6 finishes in his last five starts as he heads to a place where he tied for fourth two years ago. 8. Patrick Cantlay:Statistically in a much better spot than a year ago before this tournament when he tied for 22nd. He‚Äôs No. 1 in par-5 scoring, too. 9. Will Zalatoris:He doesn‚Äôt have a top-20 since AmEx, but he remains a top-15 or so ball-striker and excellent lag putter. Plus, his record at the Masters is crazy good ‚Äì a second, T-6 and T-9. 10. Bryson DeChambeau:Slid back to fifth on Sunday at LIV Miami, but it was still his best finish since the season opener. Now, does he have Augusta somewhat figured out after last year‚Äôs T-6? I think so.

(Photo by Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images) Getty Images  11. Tommy Fleetwood:Ranked 12th in the world rankings, which is a popular spot to be among Masters champions. He‚Äôs second in approach putting and nearly top 10 in strokes gained approach. And how about this crazy stat: He‚Äôs not finished outside the top 25 since The Open last July. 12. Sepp Straka:Has opened his Masters career with three straight made cuts, including a T-16 last year. And he continues to be solid since his AmEx win. He‚Äôs top 5 in strokes gained approach, proximity and par-5 scoring. 13. Xander Schauffele:Perfect time to buy low, as Schauffele finally shed the post-injury rust with a T-12 at Valspar, where he gained a career-best 11.276 strokes on approach. 14. Robert MacIntyre:Back in the Masters after two years away. He was T-12 in his debut and T-23 in his encore. The lefty loves this place and has really turned things around with four T-11 finishes or better in his last five starts. 15. Hideki Matsuyama:There‚Äôs always the unknown with Matsuyama. He‚Äôs coming off two straight missed cuts, including Friday at Valero, and yet no one would be surprised if he notched his ninth top-20 finish in his last 11 Masters. He‚Äôs not the top gainer around the greens on Tour, but he‚Äôs close, and he‚Äôs second in par-5 scoring. 16. Cameron Smith:Just a horse for this course with four top-10s in his last five Masters starts, including a T-6 last year. 17. Keegan Bradley:Has two straight top-25s at the Masters since getting back in the tournament after a few years away. Nothing spectacular at Valero, but he‚Äôs top 10 in proximity, which obviously will play at Augusta. 18. Min Woo Lee:Boosted by recent Houston win and now heads to Augusta, where he has two top-25s in three starts. He‚Äôs still outside the top 100 in strokes gained approach but surprisingly top 30 in proximity. Couple that was top-10 ranks in strokes gained around the green and putting. 19. J.J. Spaun:He‚Äôs the PGA Tour‚Äôs second-ranked player in strokes gained approach and possesses great speed on the greens. He‚Äôs enjoying a nice year with two runners-up already. Also T-23 in his Masters debut three years ago. My favorite sleeper this week. 20. Daniel Berger:Was T-50 in his last Masters three years ago, but his career resurgence has included six top-25s in his last seven starts. He‚Äôs top 50 in strokes gained approach and putting, but scrambling is where he‚Äôs really excelled, and that‚Äôs an underrated stat at Augusta. SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS - APRIL 06: Jordan Spieth of the United States walks on the 16th green during the final round of the Valero Texas Open 2025 at TPC San Antonio on April 06, 2025 in San Antonio, Texas. (Photo by Mike Mulholland/Getty Images) Getty Images  21. Joaquin Niemann:No top-10s yet in his Masters career, but he has cracked the top 40 in four straight appearance. Not great, but it‚Äôs not terrible either. Plus, he‚Äôs already won twice on LIV this year. 22. Jordan Spieth:The wrist certainly isn‚Äôt an issue of the past, and Spieth does have two missed cuts in his past three Masters ‚Äì with a T-4 in between, though. The good news is he‚Äôs not missing many cuts of late and he‚Äôs coming off a T-12 at Valero. Worth a flier. 23. Brooks Koepka:Was T-18 at LIV Miami after his runner-up in Singapore. He‚Äôs not been an elite GIR guy this year on LIV, but it wasn‚Äôt that long ago that he was posting a T-2 at the 2024 Masters. He should better his T-45 from last year easily despite the concerns. 24. Ludvig √Öberg:I‚Äôm going to be honest; my model doesn‚Äôt love him this week. He‚Äôs nearly outside the top 100 in strokes gained approach and putting, and his play around the greens has been the most glaring issue. Still, the guy was second last year at Augusta and won Genesis earlier this year. I‚Äôll keep him in the top 25. 25. Michael Kim:Hear me out on this one. Kim has cooled off a little since his hot run earlier this year, which included a runner-up in Phoenix and solo fourth at API. But the iron play and short game have been at a top-30 level this season and I think he‚Äôs a worthy sleeper. 26. Nicolai H√∏jgaard:Contended for a while before ultimately finishing T-16 at last year‚Äôs Masters. He‚Äôs got length, is basically a top 25 iron player and is ranked inside the top 50 in strokes gained putting. Just needs to play the par-5s better than he‚Äôs been. 27. Viktor Hovland:Three straight MCs before winning Valspar. He‚Äôs taken a couple weeks off now. Let‚Äôs just hope he‚Äôs continued to get comfortable with his swing. He‚Äôs still around the top 10 in strokes gained approach and proximity. So, hopefully he can play more like his T-7 from the 2024 Masters and not last year‚Äôs MC. 28. Corey Conners:His T-18 at Valero snapped a streak of three straight top-8s, but it‚Äôs also worth noting that he‚Äôs barely inside the top 75 in strokes gained approach and has gone MC, T-38 in his last two Masters after a hot stretch there. 29. Patrick Reed:The guy is an Augusta bruiser with four top-12s since his 2018 win. 30. Denny McCarthy:Great putter; we know that. But he‚Äôs also nearly top 10 in proximity and top 30 in strokes gained approach. He also has five top-20s in six starts and was a solid T-45 in his Masters debut last year.

Three MCs in his last four Masters starts doesn‚Äôt scare me as much as it probably should. 32. Stephan Jaeger:Missed the cut in his Masters debut last year, but he‚Äôs playing solidly of late, and he‚Äôs top 40 in strokes gained approach, around the green and putting. Just have a feeling. 33. Tyrrell Hatton:Loved the bounce-back 70 after an 11-over start through 36 holes in Miami, but he‚Äôs still only posted one top-15 on LIV since winning the DPWT‚Äôs Dubai Desert Classic at the start of the year. Was T-9 at last year‚Äôs Masters, though. 34. Akshay Bhatia:MC at Valero was a momentum killer, but he still has three top-9s in his last five starts. Also was T-35 in last year‚Äôs Masters debut. All-around talent who especially excels on the greens (top 10 in strokes gained putting). 35. Lucas Glover:Equaled his best Masters finish last year (T-20), so perhaps it‚Äôs time that his iron play (top 25 in approach, top 5 in proximity) makes him a consistent fixture here. The model likes him. 36. Nick Taylor:Got burned by last year‚Äôs MC at Masters, and he‚Äôs riding a two-straight-MC streak entering this week, too. But I just think his elite approach play is going to be rewarded here at some point. 37. Jason Day:A couple finishes in the 30s since getting back in the Masters field after a year away. Has a couple top-15s in recent events, too. His stats are all over the place, though, as he‚Äôs outside the top 100 in strokes gained putting but fourth in approach putting. 38. Phil Mickelson:His sixth in Miami followed a third in Singapore a couple starts before that. He‚Äôs not missing the cut at Augusta, it‚Äôs just a matter of if he can contend or not. Just don‚Äôt be surprised, that‚Äôs all I‚Äôll say. 39. Joe Highsmith:Another first-timer who can do everything above average except chip. Winning Cognizant was huge for his confidence. Gets the lefty bump. 40. Billy Horschel:T-38 is his best Masters finish in his last six starts here. T-4 at Valspar was his most recent result, so he has some momentum. I think he can lean on his iron game and putting enough to crack the top 40. HOUSTON, TEXAS - MARCH 30: Wyndham Clark of the United States hits his tee shot on the 17th hole during the final round of the Texas Children‚Äôs Houston Open 2025 at Memorial Park Golf Course on March 30, 2025 in Houston, Texas. (Photo by Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images) Getty Images  41. Wyndham Clark:T-5 at Houston gives him some momentum, but he‚Äôs outside the top 100 in strokes gained approach and MC‚Äôd in his Masters debut last year. He‚Äôs probably this high still based on name only. 42. Cam Davis:The T-12 last year was no fluke, but he‚Äôs not higher because he‚Äôs missed four straight cuts since a T-5 at Pebble. 43. Adam Scott:He doesn‚Äôt have a top-25 since Pebble and his Masters record of late has been average. Not worried about him too much on the greens, but he‚Äôs well outside the top 50 in strokes gained approach and proximity. 44. Taylor Pendrith:Masters debutant with a lot of power, second in par-5 scoring and a top-40 approach player. Also coming off a T-5 in Houston. 45. Tom Hoge:He‚Äôs a flusher (top 15 in strokes gained approach and fourth in proximity), but he just does not show up in majors. 46. Davis Thompson:Top-10 at The Players should give him some confidence in his Masters debut, but he‚Äôs got to putt better if he wants to contend here (nearly outside the top 150 in strokes gained putting). 47. Aaron Rai:He‚Äôs been a popular sleeper a lot in the past year or so. Top 40 in strokes gained approach with a handful of top-15s recently. Should be among the top finishing Masters rookies. 48. Maverick McNealy:Another Masters rookie who can putt the lights out and has been making huge improvements with the irons (top 30 basically in strokes gained approach). 49. Kevin Yu:Top 30 in strokes gained approach and approach putting. Has four top-20s in his last six starts. 50. Sungjae Im:Has had his moments here, and the name recognition will have some picking him, but he‚Äôs also outside the top 170 in strokes gained approach. 51. Justin Rose52. Tom Kim53. Tony Finau54.

The season√¢¬Ä¬ôs first major is always ripe with storylines, starting with Rory McIlroy√¢¬Ä¬ôs 17th appearance. This is his 11th trip to Augusta with the career grand slam on the line, andall eyes will be on the Tour√¢¬Ä¬ôs best player so far this year. Scottie Scheffler is the defending champion and the betting favorite, though the world No. 1 hasn√¢¬Ä¬ôt won yet in 2025. Last year, and in 2022, he had multiple wins on Tour before putting on the green jacket. This will be the third Masters contested since the founding of LIV Golf, and the circuit is stilllooking for a homegrown major champion. Bryson DeChambeau was a major champion before LIV, won the U.S. Open last summer as a current LIV member and now heads to the Masterscomfortable in his own skinand off a T6 last season√¢¬Ä¬îhis best finish in seven starts as a pro. Tiger Woods won√¢¬Ä¬ôt be competing while he recovers from Achilles surgery but patrons will continue to sit at the 16th green and talk abouthis magical chip-in that is now 20 years old.
